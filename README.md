## Getting Started

These instructions assume you have a working Trestle application. See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle#getting-started) section in the Trestle README.

To integrate trestle-auth, first add it to your application's Gemfile, and then run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'trestle-auth'
```

As of version 0.4.0, trestle-auth now supports multiple authentication backends including Devise/Warden.


### Option 1: Built-in Integration

Run the install generator to add the configuration to `config/initializers/trestle.rb`, and generate a `User` model and admin resource.

    $ rails generate trestle:auth:install User

(if no user model name is specified it will default to `Administrator`)

Then run your migrations with `rake db:migrate` and create an initial admin user from within `rails console`:

```ruby
User.create(email: "admin@example.com", password: "password", first_name: "Admin", last_name: "User")
```

After restarting your Rails server, any attempt to access a page within your admin will redirect you to the login page.


### Option 2: Devise Integration

If you already have an existing user model and Devise integration, you can configure trestle-auth to use that instead.

    $ rails generate trestle:auth:install User --devise

Replace `User` with the name of your Devise user model. If not specified, it will default to `Administrator`.


## Authorization

As of version 0.5.0, trestle-auth supports authorization via Pundit, CanCan, or the built-in authorization DSL. Other libraries can also be integrated by writing a custom adapter class.

### Pundit

Specify the Pundit policy within your admins using `authorize_with` and the `:pundit` option:

```ruby
Trestle.resource(:articles) do
  authorize_with pundit: ArticlePolicy
end
```

Trestle will use the Policy class to authorize based on the action name, as well as filter the accessible collection scope using the nested Policy Scope class (if defined).

#### *** TO BE IMPLEMENTED ***:

Pundit can be configured globally using `config.auth.authorize_with pundit: :auto` within `config/initializers/trestle.rb`. The Pundit policy will try to be automatically inferred, and a `Pundit::NotDefinedError` will be raised if it cannot be.

A custom scope can be specified with the `scope` option:

```ruby
config.auth.authorize_with pundit: :auto, scope: :admin
```


### CanCanCan

Specify your CanCanCan `Ability` class globally using `authorize_with` in your `config/initializers/trestle.rb` file:

```ruby
config.auth.authorize_with cancan: -> { Ability }
```

Passing the class wrapped in a Proc (or as a String) ensures that any changes will be reloaded and reflected automatically.

As with Pundit, the Ability class can also be customized on a per-admin basis:

```ruby
authorize_with cancan: SpecialAbility
```


### Built-in (DSL)

If you are not using Pundit or CanCanCan elsewhere in your application, you may find the built-in authorization DSL sufficient for your needs. Specify your admin permissions within an `authorize` block, by specifying action blocks (the name of the action followed by a `?`).

Within an action block, you can access the current user using `#current_user`. If available, the current resource instance will be yielded to the block.

```ruby
Trestle.resource(:articles) do
  authorize do
    index? do
      true
    end

    destroy? do
      current_user.admin?
    end

    update? do |article|
      article.creator == current_user || current_user.admin?
    end
  end
end
```

Multiple actions can be defined with a single block using the `actions` method:

```ruby
authorize do
  actions :edit, :update, :destroy do
    current_user.admin?
  end
end
```

There are a few special blocks (that end in `!`) that map to multiple actions. The most specific action block will be called if available before trying a more general block. If no block is defined for an action, any authorization will be rejected by default.

```ruby
authorize do
  # Maps to the index & show actions
  read! do ...

  # Maps to both the edit & update actions
  update! do ...

  # Maps to both the new & create actions
  create! do ...

  # Specify a default authorization block for all actions
  access! do ...
end
```

Finally, you can filter the collection scope using a custom scope block:

```ruby
authorize do
  scope do |collection|
    if current_user.admin?
      collection.all
    else
      collection.where(user: current_user)
    end
  end
end
```


## Configuration

After running the `trestle:auth:install` generator, check your `config/initializers/trestle.rb` for further configuration options.
