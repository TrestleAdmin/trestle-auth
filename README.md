## Getting Started

These instructions assume you have a working Trestle application. See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle#getting-started) section in the Trestle README.

To integrate trestle-auth, first add it to your application's Gemfile, and then run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'trestle-auth'
```

As of version 0.4.0, trestle-auth now supports multiple authentication backends including Devise/Warden.


### Option 1: Built-in Integration

Run the install generator to add the configuration to `config/initializers/trestle.rb`, and generate a `User` model and admin resource.

    $ rails generate trestle:auth:install User

(if no user model name is specified it will default to `Administrator`)

Then run your migrations with `rake db:migrate` and create an initial admin user from within `rails console`:

```ruby
User.create(email: "admin@example.com", password: "password", first_name: "Admin", last_name: "User")
```

After restarting your Rails server, any attempt to access a page within your admin will redirect you to the login page.


### Option 2: Devise Integration

If you already have an existing user model and Devise integration, you can configure trestle-auth to use that instead.

    $ rails generate trestle:auth:install User --devise

Replace `User` with the name of your Devise user model. If not specified, it will default to `Administrator`.


## Configuration

After running the `trestle:auth:install` generator, check your `config/initializers/trestle.rb` for further configuration options.
